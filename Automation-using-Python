1.GUI Automation using Python :

1a. Module "PyAutoGUI" performs GUI and desktop automation using python. 

  pip install pyautogui # for windows

Ex 1: Automating mouse movements 
Describe : The function again returns a point object with x and y values that gets the current position of the mouse.

import pyautogui
# returns a point object with 
# x and y values
print(pyautogui.position()) 


1bThe functions donâ€™t return anything but perform the jobs of simulating the typing of a string that is passed inside it. 
# used to access time related functions
import time 
import pyautogui

# pauses the execution of the program 
# for 5 sec
time.sleep(5) 

# types the string passed inside the 
# function
pyautogui.typewrite("Geeks For Geeks!")
